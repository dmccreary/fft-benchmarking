## Overview

An educational resource for learning how to objectively benchmark Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithms on microcontrollers and CPUs. This 10-week college course is designed for juniors and seniors with an interest in signal processing, focusing on modern ARM Cortex-M processors like those found in the Raspberry Pi Pico 2.

### What You'll Learn

- FFT algorithm fundamentals and DSP hardware acceleration
- Benchmarking methodologies for comparing FFT implementations
- ARM Cortex-M33 and M4 DSP instruction sets
- Trade-offs between integer and floating-point implementations
- Real-time signal processing on affordable microcontrollers ($6 Raspberry Pi Pico 2)
- Performance visualization and analysis techniques

## Course Structure

The course covers:
- **Foundations:** Fourier transforms, FFT algorithms, butterfly operations
- **Hardware:** ARM DSP instructions, microcontroller architectures
- **Implementation:** C language, Python libraries, assembly language analysis
- **Benchmarking:** Performance frameworks, parameter optimization, result presentation
- **Practical Application:** Real-time FFT/iFFT on Raspberry Pi Pico RP2350

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Git

### Local Development

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/dmccreary/fft-benchmarking.git
   cd fft-benchmarking
   ```

2. **Set up Python environment:**
   ```sh
   # Using conda (recommended)
   conda create -n mkdocs python=3
   conda activate mkdocs
   pip install mkdocs "mkdocs-material[imaging]"

   # OR using venv
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install mkdocs "mkdocs-material[imaging]"
   ```

3. **Run local development server:**
   ```sh
   mkdocs serve
   ```

   View the site at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)

4. **Build the site:**
   ```sh
   mkdocs build
   ```

### Deploying to GitHub Pages

```sh
mkdocs gh-deploy
```

Note: This only deploys the site. Remember to commit and push your source changes separately.
