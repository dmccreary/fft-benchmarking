# About This Course

This course is a intelligent textbook driven course
about FFT benchmarking.  It was created by Dan McCreary
to support his DIY signal processing projects such
as the [Low Cost Spectrum Analyzer](https://dmccreary.github.io/spectrum-analyzer/).

His biggest driver was the lack of good FFT benchmarking tools for low-cost
microcontrollers such as the Raspberry Pi Pico 2.  Although the Pico 2 has
powerful DSP functions, he found that most of the FFT libraries did not
use these functions.  As a result, their FFT performance was 10x slower than optimal.

He is hopeful that other instructors around the world can benefit from the
content.
